# Examples

Demonstrates using the published npm packages in both ESM and CJS environments.

## ESM (Vite)

```bash
cd esm
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173
```

## CJS (Webpack)

```bash
cd cjs
npm install
npm start
# Opens http://localhost:3001
```

## What's Demonstrated

- Installing packages from npm
- Using Free version (`@spacedevin/react-mui-multi-range-picker`)
- Using Pro version (`@spacedevin/react-mui-pro-multi-range-picker`)
