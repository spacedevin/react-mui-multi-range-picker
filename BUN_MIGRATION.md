# Bun Migration Complete ✅

We've successfully migrated from npm to Bun as the primary package manager. This eliminates `package-lock.json` merge conflicts and significantly speeds up installs and builds.

## What Changed

### Package Manager
- **Before:** npm for everything
- **After:** Bun for installs/builds/tests, npm only for `npm publish`

### Lockfiles
- ❌ **Removed:** `package-lock.json` (both packages)
- ✅ **Using:** `bun.lock` (binary format, fewer merge conflicts)
- 🚫 **Ignored:** `package-lock.json` added to `.gitignore`

### Workflows Updated

**PR Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`):**
- Tests: `bun install` → `bun test --coverage`
- Build: `bun install` → `bun run build`
- Type Check: `bunx tsc` (Bun's npx equivalent)
- Publish Check: Still uses `npm publish --dry-run`

**Main Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`):**
- Tests: `bun install` → `bun test --coverage`
- Build: `bun install` → `bun run build`
- Publish: `bun install` → `bun run build` → `npm publish`
- Demo Build: `bun install` → `bun run build`
- Commits: Now tracks `bun.lock` instead of `package-lock.json`

## Benefits

### 🚀 Speed
- **Install:** ~10-20x faster than npm
- **Test Execution:** ~2x faster than Jest/Vitest
- **Build:** Uses same TypeScript compiler (no change)

### 🔀 Merge Conflicts
- **Before:** Text-based `package-lock.json` with frequent conflicts
- **After:** Binary `bun.lock` with smart conflict resolution
- Bun automatically resolves most dependency conflicts

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- Single tool for install, test, build, and run
- Built-in TypeScript support (no ts-node needed)
- Native ESM and CommonJS support
- Compatible with npm packages

## Local Development

### Installation
```bash
# Install Bun (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test
bun test --coverage
bun test --watch

# Build packages
bun run build

# Run any npm script
bun run <script-name>
```

### Migrating from npm
```bash
# In each package directory
rm package-lock.json
bun install
```

## CI/CD Compatibility

### GitHub Actions
- Uses `oven-sh/setup-bun@v1` to install Bun
- Bun version: `latest` (auto-updates)
- Fallback to npm for publishing (npm registry requirement)

### Publishing to NPM
Still uses `npm publish` because:
1. npm CLI required for authentication
2. Ensures maximum compatibility
3. Only used in release workflow (not PR builds)

## What Stays the Same

✅ `package.json` format unchanged  
✅ npm scripts work identically  
✅ Published packages unchanged  
✅ Peer dependencies unchanged  
✅ TypeScript configuration unchanged  
✅ End-users unaffected (packages still on npm)

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Install Bun in CI/CD workflows
- [x] Replace `npm ci` with `bun install`
- [x] Replace `npm run` with `bun run`
- [x] Replace `npx` with `bunx`
- [x] Remove `package-lock.json` files
- [x] Generate `bun.lock` files
- [x] Update `.gitignore` to ignore `package-lock.json`
- [x] Update release workflow to track `bun.lock`
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Verify builds work
- [x] Document changes

## Troubleshooting

### "bun: command not found"
Install Bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### "Module not found"
Run `bun install` to install dependencies

### Tests fail locally but pass in CI
Ensure you're using same Bun version as CI (latest)

### Need to use npm for something?
You can! Bun is compatible. Just run `npm install` if needed.

## Reverting (if needed)

If you need to revert to npm:
```bash
rm bun.lock
npm install
git add package-lock.json
```

Update workflows to use `npm ci` instead of `bun install`.
