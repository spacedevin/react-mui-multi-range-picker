# What Actually Works

**Reality check**: Most CI/CD tutorials are bullshit. Here's what ACTUALLY works.

## ✅ Working Workflows (3 files)

### 1. **release.yml** - Simplified, Actually Works
- ✅ Detects changes since last tag
- ✅ Bumps patch version automatically
- ✅ Builds and publishes to NPM
- ✅ Creates GitHub releases
- ✅ Manual override with version input
- ✅ **NO race conditions** - parallel jobs work independently
- ✅ **NO deprecated actions** - uses `softprops/action-gh-release`

**What it does**: Pushes to `main` → auto-releases changed packages

### 2. **ci.yml** - Simple Build Check
- ✅ Builds both packages
- ✅ Verifies output files exist
- ✅ Runs TypeScript type checking
- ✅ No bullshit validation

**What it does**: PRs get built and tested

### 3. **pr-validation.yml** - Just Title Check
- ✅ Validates PR title format (lowercase, conventional commits)
- ✅ That's it!

**What it does**: Makes sure PR title is formatted correctly

## ❌ Removed (Overly Complex Bullshit)

### dependency-update.yml - DELETED
**Why**: 
- Too many edge cases
- `npm outdated` output varies
- Build failures hard to handle
- Creates more work than it saves

**Reality**: Just update deps manually when needed

### status-checks.yml - DELETED
**Why**:
- Redundant with CI
- Checks things that don't matter
- More complexity for zero benefit

**Reality**: CI build check is enough

## 🎯 How To Actually Use This

### Auto Release (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make changes
git checkout -b my-changes
# ... edit files ...

# 2. Commit however you want
git commit -m "whatever"
git commit -m "more stuff"

# 3. Create PR with conventional title
gh pr create --title "feat: add new feature" --fill

# 4. Merge to main
gh pr merge --squash

# 5. Done! Releases automatically
```

### Manual Release

```bash
# Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
# Select package and version
# Click Run
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Secrets

**NPM_TOKEN** - That's it!

```bash
# Create at: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/[username]/tokens
# Type: Automation
# Add to: GitHub Settings → Secrets → Actions
gh secret set NPM_TOKEN
```

### Package Setup

Both `package.json` files need:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

## 📝 Versioning Strategy

**Simplified**:
- Default: Bumps patch version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
- Manual: Specify any version in workflow dispatch

**Why not semantic-release?**
- Too complex
- Requires specific commit formats
- Breaks easily
- Not worth the hassle

**Why not conventional commits auto-bump?**
- Same reasons
- Parsing git logs is fragile
- Easier to just bump patch or manually override

## 🚀 What Happens On Push to Main

1. **Checkout** code
2. **Check** if packages changed since last tag
3. **Skip** if no changes
4. **Bump** patch version (or use manual version)
5. **Build** package
6. **Publish** to NPM
7. **Tag** repository
8. **Create** GitHub release

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes per package

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Release didn't trigger
- Did you push to `main`?
- Did files in `packages/` actually change?

### NPM publish failed
```bash
# Check token
gh secret list

# Recreate token
# 1. Delete old token on NPM
# 2. Create new Automation token
# 3. Update GitHub secret
gh secret set NPM_TOKEN
```

### Build failed
```bash
# Test locally
cd packages/MuiMultiDateRangePicker
npm ci
npm run build

# Fix whatever broke
```

### Wrong version published
```bash
# Can't unpublish (NPM policy)
# Just release a new version
gh workflow run release.yml --field package=free --field version=0.2.0
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use Squash Merge
Always squash merge PRs so git history stays clean

### 2. Skip CI on Docs
Add `[skip ci]` to commit message for docs-only changes

### 3. Manual Version Control
Use workflow dispatch when you need specific versions:
- Breaking change: `1.0.0`
- New feature: `0.2.0`
- Bug fix: `0.1.1` (or let it auto-bump)

### 4. Test Before Merge
CI runs automatically - don't merge if it's red

## 📊 Actual Workflow

```
Push to main
    ↓
Check if packages changed
    ↓ (yes)
Bump version (patch)
    ↓
npm ci
    ↓
npm run build
    ↓
npm publish
    ↓
git tag
    ↓
GitHub release
    ↓
Done! (2-3 min)
```

## 🎯 Summary

**What you actually need**:
1. NPM token
2. Push to main
3. Done

**What you don't need**:
- Complex commit message parsing
- Semantic-release
- Dependency automation
- Complicated changelog generation
- Status checks beyond build

**Philosophy**: Keep it simple, keep it working.
